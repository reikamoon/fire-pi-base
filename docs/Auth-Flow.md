Think I’ve got mine ok, marked as an ERC-20 for the proposal but might want it to be ERC-721… We want to grab images from x site that gives permission to said images and convert them to an NFT… Don’t think they would change the same as zombies or kitties or sea friends but just static images —> not fully sure which of the contracts to go off, and if there would be any other legalities around it??
