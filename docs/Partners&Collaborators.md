## Other Resources

https://www.reddit.com/r/PiNetwork/wiki/devresources a good place to start is the dev resources over on reddit...
https://github.com/pi-apps/pi-platform-docs as well as the official docs but there a bit lack IMO
This is not an information group for Pi Network. I would maybe read the white papers at https://minpi.com/white-papers
https://api.testnet.minepi.com/
